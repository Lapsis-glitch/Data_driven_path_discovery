# Isobutanol_isomerization

This repository contains the input files for starting a MD simulation for the I2 isomerization of protonated isobutanol in gas phase and the SNAr reaction of otassium methoxide and
4-fluorobenzonitrile. 

The committor consistent pathways associated with the simulation runs are located in the paths folder, for 500K and 300K
